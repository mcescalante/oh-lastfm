# The OH Last.fm Integration

This repository provides a `Django` application that interfaces both with the `Open Humans` API and the `Last.fm` API to collect top track, artist, and track listening history data from `Last.fm` and uploading it into `Open Humans`. It is based on the https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-data-demo-template and https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-twitter-source.


Still a work in progress.
